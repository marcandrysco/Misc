Miscellaneous Code
==================

This repository is a collection of miscellaneous bits of code for use in other
projects. Each mini-project is versioned so hopefully downstream projects can
be updated in a sane way. Furthermore, the entire code base may be compiled
into a single library and header for use in a project.

## Components

 * [AVL Tree (v0.1)](avl/README.md) -- Intrusive AVL tree implementation.
 * [Memory Debugger (v0.1)](mdbg/README.md) -- Debugging memory bugs (e.g.
     leaked memory or double free).
